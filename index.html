                <h3>About Outer-Rim</h3>
                <p>Outer-Rim is a group of Millenials who met on a DayZ community server. Once that community fell apart, they decided to rebuld that community</br>
                on their own. 1.0 was a mess and a headache trying to chase bugs and problems on a constant. 1.25 was a test to see if something different would</br>
            work. We tried a map called Prypiat and it was a tragic failure as it caused conflict, and that, in turn, caused team members to seperate.</br>
            With a deep understanding behind the coding adn a new knowledge and perception 1.5 came along. 1.5 was a beefed up version of 1.0.</br>
            Then here we are today with 2.0. It is a 1.5 version with all the fixes neccesary to the 1.25 DayZ update. These trials and tests </br>
            could not have been done with out the Develpment team and Administrastor hard and fully dedicated work and partnership to bring you</br>
            the Outer-Rim you know today.</p>
